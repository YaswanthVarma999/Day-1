Java Concepts :- 
1. **Variable Types: Local, Instance, and Static**
   - Differences between local, instance, and static variables.
   - Write a program to demonstrate their usage.
2. **Variable Scope**
   - How does the scope of variables differ inside methods, blocks, and classes?
   - Write a program to illustrate variable scope.
3. **Final Variables**
   - What are fnal variables in Java, and how do they behave when modifed?
   - Write a program to demonstrate the concept.
4. **Type Inference (var in Java 10+)**
   - How does Javaâ€™s `var` feature introduced in Java 10 work?
   - Write a program demonstrating type inference for variables.
5. **Static vs Non-Static Variables**
   - Difference between static and non-static variables in Java.
   - Write a program to demonstrate their behavior in memory.
6. **Primitive vs Reference Variables**
   - Differences between primitive and reference variables in Java.
   - Write a program to explain how they behave differently.
7. **Constant Variables with static fnal**
   - How to use `static fnal` variables to defne constants in Java.
   - Write a program to calculate the area and circumference of a circle using constants.
8. **Shadowing Variables**
   - What is variable shadowing in Java?
   - Write a program to demonstrate shadowing at different levels (class, method, block).
9. **Default Values of Variables**
   - What are the default values of instance and static variables in Java?
   - Write a program to display these default values.
10. **Volatile Variables**
    - Purpose of the `volatile` keyword in Java.
    - Write a program to demonstrate its effect in a multithreading scenario.

### **Programming Problems** :-
1. **String Manipulation**
   - Write a program to count the frequency of each character in a given string, ignoring case sensitivity. Use conditional statements to exclude
special characters.
2. **Anagram Checker**
   - Write a program to check if two strings are anagrams of each other. Use arrays to count character occurrences and conditional operators for
comparisons.
3. **Array Rotation**
   - Write a program to rotate an array `n` times to the right or left based on user input. Use conditional statements to handle boundary conditions.
4. **Subarray Sum**
   - Write a program to fnd the maximum sum of a contiguous subarray in a given array. Use conditional operators to update the maximum sum
dynamically.
5. **Matrix Multiplication**
   - Write a program to multiply two matrices. Use conditional statements to validate if the matrices can be multiplied based on their dimensions.
6. **Palindrome Checker**
   - Write a program to check if a given string is a palindrome. Use string manipulation and conditional statements to handle case sensitivity and
ignore spaces.
   - Write a program to compare elements of two arrays of the same size. Use conditional operators to print whether each pair of elements is
equal, greater, or lesser.
8. **Vowel and Consonant Counter**
   - Write a program to count vowels and consonants in a given string. Use conditional statements and the `switch` operator for checking vowel/
consonant conditions.
9. **Frequency of Elements**
   - Write a program to fnd the frequency of each element in an array. Use nested loops with conditional operators to count unique occurrences.
10. **Valid Parentheses**
    - Write a program to check if a given string containing only `{}`, `[]`, and `()` is valid. Use conditional statements and stacks to verify matching
brackets.
